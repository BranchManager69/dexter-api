# Continue Progress: Realtime Identity & MCP JWT

## Objective
- Let realtime sessions distinguish guests vs. signed-in users and surface that metadata to clients.
- Issue per-user dexter_mcp_jwt tokens during connector OAuth so hosted MCP tools can trust the caller.
- Document the new environment knobs (OIDC client info, MCP JWT secret/TTL, allowlists) for future deploys.

## Current State
- /realtime/sessions verifies optional Supabase access tokens, normalizes identity, adds guest-profile instructions, and returns a dexter_session block.
- Connector OAuth token + refresh responses now include dexter_mcp_jwt via the new helper src/utils/mcpJwt.ts (covered by 	ests/mcpJwt.test.ts).
- src/env.ts, .env.example, and the README list the new env vars; package deps include jsonwebtoken.
- Changes are still uncommitted; .env needs real values for MCP_JWT_SECRET, TTL, and optional OIDC config before deployment.

## Next Actions
1. Populate local .env with the new secrets (and mirror to dexter-ops/.env if needed).
2. Run 
pm test, 
pm run lint, and a manual exercise of:
   - POST /realtime/sessions with/without supabaseAccessToken to confirm identity switching.
   - /api/connector/oauth/token + refresh to ensure dexter_mcp_jwt returns and validates.
3. Align FE/agents with the new dexter_session envelope if any consumers expect the shape to change.
4. Once validated, commit the current diff on main and push.
